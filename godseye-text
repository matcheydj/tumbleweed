[SECRET] God's Eye Satellite

INVALID

The Israeli Air Force has always had prominent divisions since the dawn of hacking which have excelled at what they do. This is their latest project; a small satellite which can act as a gateway to other satellites, and independent from helping hack into other satellites, can send out targeted EMP strikes on villages, cities, even entire nations if their electrical grid is vulnerable enough.

The satellite would otherwise be used to collect metadata and have a capacity of up to 800 Terabytes of data storage. Mainly it would be targeted for data collection within the immediate region (The Levant, Gulf States) and look for information relating to terrorist activity. The satellite would have the capability to in real time send data back, as well as have data uploaded to it so that edits of the code could be made by approved handlers if need be.

The EMP feature, while something the Israeli Air Force can do on their own, is a way to automate the process of writing scripts. Instead of specifying a target, the basic code for an EMP/communication jam is written and sent to the satellite to be targeted on a whim. They can, of course, shut it off manually or choose to do it by themselves. The goal, in the end, is to have the satellite by a kind of fourth defense against invasion. Should a country try to invade, the satellite can target each individual country and jam their signal, cut power, overload power plants or nuclear reactors... Whatever needed to get done to save the country.

Writing of the code should take no more than 2 weeks. Assembly of the satellite might at best take 4 years, at worst 6. If information about this project were ever released to the public, the Israeli Air Force would say that it is designed to collect data on weather patterns and help with Israeli satellite TV watching
